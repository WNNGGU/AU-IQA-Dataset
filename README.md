# AU-IQA-Dataset

This dataset is designed to evaluate the perceptual quality of **AI-enhanced user-generated content (AI-UGC)** images. It targets hybrid content that combines characteristics of both **UGC** and **AIGC**, providing a challenging benchmark for current IQA models.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes **three common types of AI enhancement tasks**, each simulating real-world user scenarios:

- **Blur or low-resolution (Super-Resolution):**  
  AI-enhanced results for low-resolution or blurred images.

- **Lighten (Low-Light Enhancement):**  
  Images taken in dark conditions, enhanced by AI for improved brightness and visibility.

- **Noise (Denoising):**  
  Images with synthetic or natural noise, processed by AI models to restore clean textures.

Each image has been enhanced by multiple state-of-the-art models and manually rated for perceptual quality.
